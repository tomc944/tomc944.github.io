# Snake
You can start playing at the live link [here] (http://tomc944.github.io/Snake/).
To look at jQueryLite, the framework I built and used extensively in this game, click [here] (https://github.com/tomc944/jquery_lite).

### Description
The goal is simple: eat the apple, designated by the red square and rejoice when your snake gets larger! See how long you can go.

### Instructions
The snake is controlled using WASD.

### Technical Details
This Snake game was made without the use of jQuery. My own framework jQueryLite was used for all of the necessary DOM manipulation during rendering. Quick class addition and removal was necessary to keep track of where the snakes and apple were at all times within the game container.

### Future Features
* Implement two-player snake
* Add backend so there could be a leaderboard
* Buttons for 1P or 2P mode
