###Goofy Breakout

Everyone remembers Breakout, the cult-classic Atari game from the early 80s, but we have all seen that. There's a ball and there are some bricks. In this version of Breakout, you can play normally, or you can play goofy! Throw bricks at a face!

This game was implemented using JS and the extended Phaser library to quickly and effectively add physics, sprites, and other goodies.

Go ahead, play!
