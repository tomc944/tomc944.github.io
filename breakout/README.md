#Goofy Breakout

Everyone remembers Breakout, the cult-classic Atari game from the mid 70s, but we have all seen that. There's a ball and there are some bricks. In this version of Breakout, you can play normally, or you can play goofy! Throw wrenches at a face!

This game was implemented using JS and the extended Phaser library to quickly and effectively add physics, sprites, and other goodies.

Go ahead, [play] (http://tomc944.github.io/breakout/)!
