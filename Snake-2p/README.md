You can start playing at the live link [here]. (http://tomc944.github.io/Snake-2p/)

### Description
Two-Person Snake is a tweak on the classic Snake game. Instead of one player controlling a snake, we have two different snakes controlled by two different users.

The goal is simple: eat the apple, designated by the red square and rejoice when your snake gets larger! See how long you can go.

### Instructions
The white snake is controlled using W,S,A,D
The blue snake is controlled using I,K,J,L

### Technical Details
This Snake game was made without the use of jQuery. My own framework jQueryLite was used for all of the necessary DOM manipulation during rendering. Quick class addition and removal was necessary to keep track of where the snakes and apple were at all times within the game container.

### Future Features
Add scoring for both blue and white snake.
Be able to play basic one-player mode.
